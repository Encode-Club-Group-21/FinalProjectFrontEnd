# Bet On You
Bet on You is a Dapp that allows anyone to bet on themselves by setting a goal and putting some money on it. Once the goal is achieved, one is able to claim back their money.
For now, we only support bets about chess using the chess.com api. 

You are able to 1) create a goal 2) cancel the goal within the next hour if a mistake was made 3) claim your money once the goal is accomplished.

You can view your goals and check if they are completed directly on the Dapp.

## Steps to claim
In order to claim a goal, you first need to update the contract. You will be able to do so once you achieve your goal. Once the contract is updated, you will be able to claim your money!
